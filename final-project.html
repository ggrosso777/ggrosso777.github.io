    <p>This is my final project game, Defend! It's a tower defense game where your main objective is to defend a small tower within the center of the screen while enemies constantly move towards it and try to kill you. As the game goes on, you get money from enemies killed to purchase towers to make defending your base easier. However, with each enemy you kill, the next ones will only grow stronger, until you're met with the ulimate monster force! In order to prevail, you must survive for ten minutes. Do you have what it takes?</p>
